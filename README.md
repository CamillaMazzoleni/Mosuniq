# Mosuniq - The Mosaic Robot

The purpose of my project was to automate the process of creating mosaics by developing a software tool that can process images into a mosaic image and then designing and building a machine that is capable of picking and placing tiles to recreate it. This  project involved different disciplines, like informatics, statistics, mechanics, electronics and control system.
I developed a library in Python of an optimized clustering algorithm to process the image and designed an efficient and cost-effective mechanical system in Solidworks. The project also included the electrical design, schematics and PCBs for the control of mechanical components.
